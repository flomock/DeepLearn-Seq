# DeepLearn-Seq
## python scripts used in my Masterthesis to predict the host of a virus based on its genome sequence
__Mainly important scripts are:__

__deep_learning_sequences.py__
- what is able do create, test and evaluate different neural networks

__from_db_to_train_set.py__
- what creates a stratisfied training and testing set from a mongo db

__GridSearchOnServer.py__
- trains a GBM model

the other scripts are mainly copied from previos work from https://github.com/phiweger
who used GBM to predict the host of a virus
